## Learn CSS: Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  
    - It means that it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.  
    - The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis. the main axis is set by the ```flex-direction``` property

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?  
    - Changing how data is visually renedered does not change how its written in HTML. If an lists order is changed using CSS a screen reader would not read it the in the order it is displayed.
