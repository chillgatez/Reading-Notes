# Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.  
    -Syntax errors are spelling errors, typos, things that would stop your code from running. Logic errors are when your code doesn't run in the way you may have intended. There usually aren't any error messages for these.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.  
    -  I ran into both sytax and logic errors. I don't remember all of them. I know I solved a most of them by following the error messages on the console. There was an infinite loop that broke my code. In that instance I had to rewrite my code.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?  
    -  I make syntax errors often. Way too often. 

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  
    - The debugger tool runs through your code and detects errors. It's the check engine light checker for your code. It won't necessarily tell you how to fix the problem but it will tell you that there is a problem and what could be causing it. 

2. Define what a breakpoint is.  
    - A breakpoint is a where you pause execution in your code. You set a breakpoint to indentify problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

3. What is the call stack?
    - It's a list of functions that have been called up to the point of error. It shows you what code has been executed to get to the current line.
