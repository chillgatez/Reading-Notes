## Class 7 Reading Notes

### Programming with JavaScript
_____
#### Control Flow
- __Control flow__ is the oreder in which a computer executes the statements in a script

- Code is run in order from the first line to the last line, unless the computer runs across a structure that changes the control flow (conditionals and loops)

- Control flow means reading the script from start to finish _and_ also looking at program structure and how it affects order of execution

#### JavaScript Functions
- JavaScript *funcstion:* is a block of code designed to perform a particular task  

- The function is executed when  something calls (invokes) it meaning:  

    - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
    - When it is invoked from JavaScript code
    - Automatically (self invoked)

- The () Operator invokes the function;  

    - *Arithmetic Operators* - used to perform arithmetic on numbers.

    - *Assignment Operators* - adds a value to a variable

    - *Comparison Operators* - used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

    - *Logical Operators* - used to determine the logic between variables or values.

    - *Conditional Operators* - 

    - *Type Operators* - convert variables to a new variable and another data type.

- When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

- Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"; accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

- If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.


    __*JavaScript Function Syntax*__   

    - A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by *parentheses* ().  

        - Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).  

            - The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)  

                - The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

- Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

- Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

- Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

- Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
