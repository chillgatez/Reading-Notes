#### Some Things to Remember About __Growth Mindset__
- Questions for reflecting on *all* aspects of my day/work:  
    1. What was the _best_ part of the day?
    3. What went _wrong_? How can I make sure it doesn't happen again?  
    7. Which aspects of my work am I _most proud_ of?
    4. What can I do to __*improve*__ the aspects Iâ€™m _less proud_ of?
- Hard work may not feel good now but it will pay off later.
- My peers are my ~~competition~~ community. Our teamwork makes the dream work!
