## Class 6 Reading Notes

### Javascript
_____
#### Introduction
**JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language w first-class functions.
- not to be confused with the Java programming language â€” JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java." The two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
- JavaScript is also used in non-browser enviornments such as Node.js, Apache Couch DB, and Acrobat.
-supports object0oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional progamming) styles.
- capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation. object introspection, and source-code recovery.
- There are 3 major parts of what is uslally refered to as "JavaScript"
    - The language itself
    - the DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser
    - The provided server API
- can be used w any text editor
- JavaScript code can be directly embedded inside the HTML file or externally by adding a line in the HTML file that includes the external JavaScript file (recommended)

#### Some basic outputs  

- **_alert_** will show a pop-up in the browser w text. 
    ```
    <script language="javascript">  

    alert("Hello World");  

    </script>
    ```
- **document.write** function changes the content of the page.
``` 
    First line
    <script>

    document.write("<h1>Hello World</h1>");

    </script>
    Last line
```

- Developers usually print out debugging information using **console.log**
```  
    <script>

    console.log("Hello World");

    </script>
```

*** Most of the web browsers provide what is called a "JavaScript console". It is an additional window which is normally not visible, where the browser can print out warnings and errors generated by the execution of the JavaScript code. (E.g. if there is a syntax error in the code.) The developer can also print information to this console using the ```  console.log() call.  ```
