## Class 01

### Today we learned about headings from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings)

Paragraphs are created by *leaving a space between lines*.  
Line breaks are created by *leaving two spaces after the first line*.  
Use double **astericks** or double __underscores__ for **bold** text.  
Use a single *asterick* or single _underscore_ to italicize.  
Triple up for a ***combination*** **of the two**  
You can use **_two_** **astericks** followed by an _underscore_ or __*two*__ __underscores__ followed by an *asterick*

>Block quotes are simple  just add ">" in front of a paragrpah
