## Class 01

### Today we learned about headings from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings)

Paragraphs are created by *leaving a space between lines*.  
Line breaks are created by *leaving two spaces after the first line*.  
Use double **astericks** or double __underscores__ for **bold** text.  
Use a single *asterick* or single _underscore_ to italicize.  
Triple up for a ***combination*** **of the two**  
You can use **_two_** **astericks** followed by an _underscore_ or __*two*__ __underscores__ followed by an *asterick*

>**Block quotes** are simple  just add **>** in front of a paragraph
>
> Add *>* in the blank lines between for *block quotes* with **multiple paragraphs**
>> for **nested quotes** double up on *>*
>> - You can add elements like *__this bullet point__*
>> - You can also **bold** and *italicize* text withing the *nested quote*

it is **_good practice_** leave a blank line before and after **block quotes**

Creating a **list** is easy
