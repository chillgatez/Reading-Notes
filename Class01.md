## Class 01

### Today we learned about headings from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings)

Paragraphs are created by *leaving a space between lines*.  
Line breaks are created by *leaving two spaces after the first line*.  
Use double **astericks** or double __underscores__ for **bold** text.  
Use a single *asterick* or single _underscore_ to italicize.  
Triple up for a ***combination*** **of the two**  
You can use **_two_** **as

tericks** followed by an _underscore_ or __*two*__ __underscores__ followed by an *asterick*

>**Block quotes** are simple  just add **>** in front of a paragraph
>
> Add *>* in the blank lines between for *block quotes* with **multiple paragraphs**
>> for **nested quotes** double up on *>*
>> - You can add elements like *__this bullet point__*
>> - You can also **bold** and *italicize* text withing the *nested quote*

it is **_good practice_** leave a blank line before and after **block quotes**

Creating a **list** is easy
1. create **ordered lists**
2. by adding line items
3. with numbers followed by periods
4. the numbers dont have to be in
7. numerical order
10. the list just needs to 
5. start with the number 1 

To create an __unordered list__
- use - + or * in front of line itmes
- you __can not create__ an unordered list using different characters
  1. i.e.
  2.  "-" line item
  3.  "*" line item
  4.  "+" line item
  5.  indent one of more items to create a __nested list__
  6.  use _backslash_ to start a list with a number followed by a period
  7.  102\. you can add elements such as:

      a _paragraph_
  8. or
      > _block quote_
  9. or
          <html>
            <head>
              <title>code block</title>
            </head>
    10. or an image

  - It is also possible to create an ordered list within an unordered list and vice versa
  - Im going to close this list out by using _three_ underscores on a single line to create a __horitontal rule__
  - You can also use *asterisks* or *dashes*
