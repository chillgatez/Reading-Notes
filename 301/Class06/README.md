# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    - one of the creators of the HTTP protocol
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    - it "applies verbs to nouns" the HTTP protocol tells the browser what to do.
4. What does a ```GET``` do?
    - retrieves data from another system
5. What does a ```POST``` do?
    - adds data from one system to another
6. What does ```PUT``` do?
    - replaces data in another system
7. What does ```PATCH``` do?
    - partially updates data in a nother system
