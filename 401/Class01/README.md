# Class 01 Reading: Exception Handling

## C# Hello World

    This topic is essential for the assignment as it provides the foundation for building the math game program. The tutorial guides users through the process of setting up the development environment, creating the application, and running it using the .NET CLI. By following the tutorial, users gain the necessary knowledge and skills to construct and execute their programs. Understanding this topic is comparable to building a house, where Visual Studio Code serves as the construction site and the code files represent the structure, and running the program is equivalent to completing the construction and allowing interaction.

## C# Accepting user input from the console
    
    Getting user input is similar to a conversation between two people. If you are having a conversation with a friend, and you ask them a question their response provides the input that you need to continue the conversation or perform a specific action. In the context of the numbers game, the user's input through Console.ReadLine() acts as the response to the program's prompts, allowing the program to proceed with the game logic based on the user's input. Just like in a conversation, if the user provides incorrect or unexpected input, the program may encounter errors or exceptions, which can be handled accordingly.

## C# Methods

    Methods can be thought of as parts of a whole. They are individual tasks that need to be performed in a larger project. Going back to the construction analogy, and each construction worker is assigned a specific task such as laying bricks, painting walls, or installing electrical wiring. Each task is like a method, where the worker performs a particular action when called upon. By breaking down the overall project into smaller tasks (methods), you can reuse code (workers) and ensure efficiency and organization in the construction process. Similarly, in C# programming, methods allow us to divide complex tasks into smaller, reusable units of code, making our programs more organized, modular, and easier to maintain.

## Debugging

    Debugging is like solving a puzzle. When you encounter unexpected behavior in your code, it's like a puzzle with missing pieces or pieces that don't fit together properly. Debugging helps you identify the missing or misfitting pieces and allows you to analyze and correct them one by one. Just as you step through a puzzle to find the right pieces, stepping through your code in a debugger helps you find the exact point where the problem occurred and make the necessary corrections. By effectively utilizing debugging techniques, you can solve the puzzle of your code and achieve the desired functionality and outcomes in the math game.
